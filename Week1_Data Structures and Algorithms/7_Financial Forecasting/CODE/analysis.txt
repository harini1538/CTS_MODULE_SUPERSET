 Analysis
Time Complexity:

The recursive function runs once for each year.

So, time complexity is O(n) where n = number of years.

Space Complexity:

Each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack.

Space complexity is also O(n) because of the recursion depth.

Advantages of Recursion
The logic is clean and easy to understand.

Matches the natural structure of problems involving repeated growth or steps.
Disadvantages
Uses more memory than a loop due to recursive stack frames.

Can cause a stack overflow error if the number of years is very large.

When to Use
Use recursion for short-term forecasting or when clarity of code is important.

Use an iterative approach for large year values to improve performance and prevent stack overflow.
