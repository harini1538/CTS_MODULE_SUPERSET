 Analysis
Add Task:
Time complexity is O(n)
We must go to the end of the list to add the new task.

Search Task:
Time complexity is O(n)
We search each node one by one until we find the task.

Delete Task:
Time complexity is O(n)
We first search for the task and then update the links.

Traverse Tasks:
Time complexity is O(n)
We go through every task from the beginning to the end.

 Advantages of Linked List over Arrays
No fixed size — the list can grow as needed.

Inserting and deleting tasks is easier and doesn't require shifting other elements.

Better suited for dynamic systems where tasks change often.
