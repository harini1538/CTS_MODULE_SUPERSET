Analysis
Linear Search

Checks each book one by one.

Easy to implement.

Works even if the list is not sorted.

Slower when the number of books is large.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Binary Search

Divides the list and checks the middle element.

Only works if the list is sorted.

Much faster for large collections.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

When to Use What
Use linear search for small or unsorted book lists.

Use binary search for large and sorted book lists.
