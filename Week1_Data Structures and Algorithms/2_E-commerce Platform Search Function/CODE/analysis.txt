ANALYSIS


Big O notation makes it easier to comprehend how an algorithm's speed varies as the number of products rises.
Searching Linearly
examines every product individually.
Easy to use, even if the list isn't sorted.
slower when there are a lot of items.
Complexity of time: O(n)
Binary Search: Always begins in the centre and divides the search space in half.
only functions if the product list has already been sorted.
a lot quicker when there are a lot of products.
Complexity of time: O(log n)
In contrast:
Linear search is easier but slower for large lists.
Binary search requires sorted data but is faster.
Which one should I use?
For small or unsorted lists, use linear search.
For extensive and sorted product lists, use binary search.
On actual e-commerce sites:
For quicker search results, binary search or database indexing is preferable.
