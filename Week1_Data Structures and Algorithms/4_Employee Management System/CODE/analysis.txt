Array Representation in Memory
Arrays are stored in a continuous block of memory, making access by index fast and efficient.

Advantages of Arrays

Easy to use and understand

Fast access to any element using index

Good when the number of employees is fixed or small

Time Complexity of Operations

Add: O(1) (if space is available)

Search: O(n) (checks each employee one by one)

Traverse: O(n) (visits all elements)

Delete: O(n) (shifts elements after deletion)

Limitations of Arrays

Fixed size — can’t grow once full

Slow insert/delete in the middle due to shifting

Not memory-efficient if array is too large and unused

When to Use Arrays
Use arrays when the number of employees is known and does not change often. Avoid them if you expect a lot of add/delete operations.
