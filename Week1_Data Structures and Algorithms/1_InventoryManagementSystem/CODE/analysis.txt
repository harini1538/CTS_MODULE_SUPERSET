ANALYSIS
Big O notation helps understand how fast inventory operations (like add, update, delete) perform as the number of products increases.

Using ArrayList:

Stores items in a simple list format.

Adding to the end is usually fast.

Searching or updating takes longer since it may need to check each item.

Time complexity:

Add: O(1) (at end), O(n) (at specific position)

Search/Update/Delete: O(n)

Using HashMap:

Stores products using a key (like productId), so it can find items directly.

Faster for search, update, and delete.

Works well even with large inventories.

Time complexity:

Add: O(1)

Search: O(1)

Update: O(1)

Delete: O(1)

In contrast:

ArrayList is easier but slower for large inventories.

HashMap is faster and more efficient for quick access by productId.

Which one should I use?

Use ArrayList for small or simple systems.

Use HashMap for large inventories with frequent updates or lookups.

On actual inventory systems:

HashMap or database tables with indexing are better for fast and scalable inventory management.
